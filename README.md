# Repository naming
Salutions, fellow colleagues. 
Due to complexities of the situation I am currently in, the repository in question has been assigned a mildly unconventional name - "baa". 
Sadly, we can't and won't change it. I apologize for the inconvinience. 

# What is this?!
This is a Datapack and a Resource Pack combination to enchance your traditional experience of a popular game called "Minecraft".
It adds a lot of new essential features so useful the "Mojang" team should consider about implimenting inside of their project. 

# Installation
To install the following Datapack, one shall clone the following repository, then they shall put the repository folder into the datapacks/ directory in their world.
After that, they shall clone the [Resource Pack](https://github.com/tacocat820/rp-baa) and put it into the directory where it belongs to, with the other resource packs. 

For easier installation, one can use a [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) created for simplifying the installation process.
